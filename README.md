# Graph_Plotting
This repo will be devoted to adding anything useful about plotting whenever it comes up writing other codes.
In Graph_Plotting_with_Coordinates you will see reading a bunch of points (nodes) from a text file and forming a tuple of them. Afterward, you should define which edges and how they interact with each other. Enough! The resulting Directed (if G=DiGraph) or Undirected (if G=Graph) is here.
